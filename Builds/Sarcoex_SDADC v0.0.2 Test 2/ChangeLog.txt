v0.0.2

* Profile system implemented
* Dynamic changing of monitor setup implemented
* Custom icon support

HOW TO USE THE NEW FEATURES

Profile system:

1. Create a new file in the folder "profiles", name it anyway you like
2. Follow this simple syntax:
	<Title of the profile>
	<The name of the playback device>
	<The filename of the icon you wish to use (from "Resources" folder)>
3. Save the file and launch the software (start.bat)
4. For each new profile you have created you will be prompted with a dialog choice, I suggest you change your monitor setup before closing/accepting the dialog, you can also decline, but no monitor config will be created.


Custom icons:

Place all icons you want to use under the "Resources" folder, the images should be 128x128 of size.
